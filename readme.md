## About this project

I am making a project in Laravel for fun, building a portfolio, and getting back into web development after a long break away.

This project will be a web app for doctors clinics, and it will have the following features:

Database wise:

 - Patients have the ability to create an account and make an appointment to see a doctor
 - Clinic admins i.e receptionist has access to a back-end to add bookings manually i.e appointments that come in over the phone
 - Doctors have days they are in, and can submit leave
 - Patients are linked to an 'account', and can see (later pay) invoices, and see outstanding balances
 
Other features:

-   Patients can choose which doctor they see
-   Doctors can have speacialsed areas, patients can choose what the problem is, and will reccomend a doctor if appropriate i.e womens issues, skin infections
*  Front-end Calendar that links to a database that the admins/doctors control.
